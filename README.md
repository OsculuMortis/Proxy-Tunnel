Proxy Tunnel: Share your internet as a web proxy with auto DDNS and easy Windows setup.

Proxy Tunnel – Description & How to Use
What it does:

Proxy Tunnel lets you share your internet connection with others by running a secure web proxy server on your Windows PC.
Others can connect to your proxy and browse the web as if they were at your location. 
The app also supports automatic Dynamic DNS (No-IP), so your proxy address always stays up to date.

How to use:

To Host (share your connection):
Open Proxy Tunnel and select “Host Mode.”
Enter a port (e.g., 8080) and click “Start.”
Click “Dynamic DNS (No-IP) Settings,” enter your No-IP hostname, username, and password, and save.
Forward the chosen port on your router to your PC.
Share your No-IP hostname and port (e.g., myproxy.ddns.net:8080) with friends.

To Connect (use someone else’s connection):
Get the host’s No-IP hostname and port.
Open Proxy Tunnel and select “Client Mode.”
Enter the host’s address (e.g., myproxy.ddns.net:8080) and click “Start.”
All your web traffic will now go through the host’s internet connection.


It does not tunnel all network traffic (only web traffic: HTTP/HTTPS).
It does not work for apps or games that do not use the system proxy settings.
It does not tunnel non-web protocols (like torrents, some chat apps, or custom software).
It does not work on mobile data (cellular) connections—only Wi-Fi where you can set a proxy.
It does not provide full VPN features (no encryption of all device traffic, no virtual network interface).
It does not work on devices that don’t support proxy settings (some smart TVs, consoles, IoT devices).
